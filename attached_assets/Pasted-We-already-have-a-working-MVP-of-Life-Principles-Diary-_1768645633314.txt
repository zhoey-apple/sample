We already have a working MVP of "Life Principles Diary".
Now apply the following modifications WITHOUT breaking existing logic.

--------------------------------
1. CALENDAR: ADD WEEK NUMBER (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------

Enhance the calendar view to display WEEK NUMBERS.

Requirements:
- Each row (week) in the monthly calendar must display its ISO week number
- Week number should be visually aligned on the left side of the calendar grid
- Week numbering must follow ISO-8601 standard
- Week numbers are for reference only (non-clickable for now)

Design principle:
- Time awareness is more important than visual simplicity
- Week number must be clearly readable but not dominant

--------------------------------
2. COMMAND PALETTE (CTRL + P)
--------------------------------

Add a global command palette triggered by:
- Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux)
- Cmd + P (Mac)

Command palette behavior:
- Opens an overlay input box
- User can type to search commands

Required commands (MVP only):
- "Create / Open Year Plan"
- "Create / Open Month Plan"
- "Create / Open Week Plan"
- "Create / Open Day Plan"

Command logic:
- If the selected plan for the current time already exists → open it
- If it does not exist → create it automatically and open it

Examples:
- Selecting "Year Plan" opens the current year's plan
- Selecting "Week Plan" opens the current ISO week plan

Rules:
- Do NOT ask the user to manually enter dates
- Always infer date context automatically

--------------------------------
3. LEFT SIDEBAR: PLAN FILE TREE
--------------------------------

Add a left sidebar with a folder-style structure.

Folder hierarchy (fixed, non-editable order):

- Yearly
  - All year plans (grouped by year)
- Monthly
  - All month plans (grouped by year)
- Weekly
  - All week plans (grouped by year)
- Daily
  - All daily plans (grouped by year / month)

Behavior:
- Clicking a plan opens it
- Sidebar reflects ONLY existing plans
- Sidebar is a navigation tool, not a content editor

Design rules:
- Folder names are fixed and cannot be renamed
- No drag & drop in MVP
- No deletion from sidebar (delete inside page only)

--------------------------------
4. ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------

- Do NOT duplicate data
- Sidebar items must be generated from the same plan data model
- Command palette actions must reuse existing creation logic
- Calendar, sidebar, and command palette must stay in sync

--------------------------------
5. PRIORITY ORDER
--------------------------------

Implement in this order:
1. Week number in calendar
2. Sidebar folder navigation
3. Command palette (Ctrl + P)

Do NOT refactor unrelated code unless necessary.
Leave UI styling minimal.
Focus on correctness and consistency.

Explain key implementation decisions in comments.
