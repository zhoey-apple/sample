Implement full responsive design to support mobile and tablet devices.
Do NOT create a separate mobile app. This must be a responsive web app.

Overall Goal:
- The diary website must automatically adapt to different screen sizes.
- Core writing and planning workflows must remain usable on mobile.

Responsive Breakpoints:
- Desktop: ≥ 1024px
- Tablet: 768px – 1023px
- Mobile: ≤ 767px

Layout Rules:

1. Desktop (unchanged behavior):
- Left sidebar (document list) visible by default
- Center editor visible
- Right sidebar (calendar + outline) visible by default

2. Tablet:
- Center editor remains primary focus
- Left sidebar collapsed by default
- Right sidebar collapsed by default
- Sidebars can be opened via:
  - Sidebar icons
  - Keyboard shortcuts (if external keyboard is connected)

3. Mobile:
- Single-column layout
- Center editor occupies full screen
- Left and right sidebars are hidden by default
- Sidebars open as overlay panels (slide-in or modal-style)
- Only one sidebar can be open at a time

Sidebar Behavior on Mobile:
- Opening a sidebar should:
  - Overlay the editor
  - Dim the background editor slightly
- Closing sidebar returns user to editor immediately
- Sidebar state should be remembered during the session

Calendar (Right Sidebar) on Mobile:
- Calendar must remain fully functional
- Display modes:
  - Default: month view
  - Compact spacing for small screens
- Highlight:
  - Today
  - Dates with existing documents
- Tapping a date:
  - Creates or opens the daily page
  - Automatically closes the calendar panel

Document List (Left Sidebar) on Mobile:
- Folder-based structure:
  - yearly
  - monthly
  - weekly
  - daily
- Folders are collapsible
- Long-press or tap-and-hold:
  - Opens context menu (delete document)

Editor Behavior on Mobile:
- Editor must remain fully editable:
  - Typing
  - Deleting
  - Undo / redo
  - Checklist toggling
- No read-only mode on mobile
- Cursor behavior must be stable

Touch Interaction:
- Replace hover-only interactions with:
  - Tap
  - Long-press
- Tooltip content (shortcuts, hints):
  - Accessible via long-press on mobile
  - Or displayed in a small helper popup

Onboarding & Help on Mobile:
- First-time user guide must be mobile-friendly:
  - Vertical scrolling
  - No hover dependencies
- Question-mark (?) help icons:
  - Tap to open explanation
  - Tap outside to close

Performance Constraints:
- Avoid heavy animations on mobile
- Ensure fast initial load
- No blocking layout shifts

Accessibility:
- Font sizes must scale appropr
