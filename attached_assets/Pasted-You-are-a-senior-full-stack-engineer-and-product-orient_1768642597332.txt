You are a senior full-stack engineer and product-oriented builder.

Your task is to build an MVP web application called:

"Life Principles Diary"

This is NOT a simple todo app.
It is a structured diary system organized by time (year / month / week / day),
with a strong emphasis on principles, continuity, and inheritance.

--------------------------------
1. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

Follow these principles strictly:

1. Principles First:
   All plans (year / month / week / day) must be traceable back to ONE global document:
   "Life Principles".

2. Single Main Goal:
   Each year can only have ONE main goal.

3. Embed, Not Copy:
   Lower-level plans must REFERENCE higher-level plans.
   Do NOT duplicate text.
   Updates to upper levels must automatically reflect everywhere.

4. Unfinished Tasks Must Persist:
   Unfinished tasks NEVER disappear automatically.
   They must flow into the next time period until completed or manually deleted.

5. Time Is the Core Structure:
   Everything is organized by date.
   A day without a date is invalid.

6. Lightweight but Serious:
   Keep the UI simple.
   No gamification.
   No social features.
   No AI analysis.

--------------------------------
2. MVP SCOPE (STRICT)
--------------------------------

You MUST implement ONLY the following modules:

- User authentication (email login only)
- Life Principles (single document per user)
- Daily Plan
- Weekly Plan
- Calendar-based navigation

Do NOT implement:
- Social features
- Public sharing
- AI analysis
- Mobile optimization
- Multi-device sync

--------------------------------
3. CORE USER FLOW (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------

The calendar is the ONLY entry point for Daily Plans.

Calendar behavior:
- Show current month
- Highlight today
- Clicking a date:
  - If a daily plan exists → open it
  - If not → automatically create it and open it

There must be:
- One daily plan per date
- No "New Daily Plan" button

--------------------------------
4. DATA MODEL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

Use a unified data model for plans:

Plan {
  id
  userId
  type: "year" | "month" | "week" | "day"
  date (ISO format)
  content (structured fields)
  references (IDs of related plans)
  unfinishedTasks
  createdAt
  updatedAt
}

Embedding rules:
- Embedded content must be dynamically queried by reference
- Never duplicate stored text

--------------------------------
5. DAILY PLAN STRUCTURE (CORE)
--------------------------------

A daily plan must support the following sections:

1. Direction
   - Embedded monthly plan
   - Embedded weekly focus

2. Time Continuity
   - Link to yesterday
   - Link to tomorrow

3. Task Flow
   - Unfinished tasks from yesterday (auto inherited)
   - Today's tasks
   - Unfinished today (persist forward)

4. Ideas
   - Free text notes

5. Habits (lightweight)
   - Maximum 2 habits
   - Checkbox completion

6. On This Day in History
   - Show ideas from the same date in previous years

Important:
- Filling ONLY one section (e.g. today's tasks) still counts as valid usage

--------------------------------
6. WEEKLY PLAN (BASIC VERSION)
--------------------------------

Weekly plan should:
- Reference the current month
- Inherit unfinished tasks from last week
- Allow reflection text
- Define focus for the current week

--------------------------------
7. TECH STACK GUIDANCE
--------------------------------

- Use a modern web stack (React / Next.js or equivalent)
- Use a simple database (SQLite / Postgres / Prisma acceptable)
- Use Markdown for text editing
- Authentication can be simple and secure

--------------------------------
8. DELIVERY STRATEGY
--------------------------------

Build the project incrementally:

Step 1:
- Auth
- Calendar
- Daily Plan creation & navigation

Step 2:
- Task inheritance logic
- Weekly Plan basics

Step 3:
- Life Principles document and embedding

Always prioritize:
- Correct logic over UI polish
- Data integrity over features

--------------------------------
9. SUCCESS CONDITION
--------------------------------

The MVP is successful if:
- A user can use it continuously for 7 days
- Unfinished tasks persist correctly
- Principles → Plans → Actions are logically connected

Start with a clean architecture.
