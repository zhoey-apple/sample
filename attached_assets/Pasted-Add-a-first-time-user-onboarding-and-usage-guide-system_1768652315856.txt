Add a first-time user onboarding and usage guide system.
Do NOT remove existing features.
Do NOT redesign the main editor layout.

Requirements:

1. First-Time Usage Detection:
- Detect whether the user is opening the diary app for the first time.
- Criteria:
  - No existing yearly plan AND no core principles document.
- If first-time usage is detected:
  - Automatically display a usage guide page.
- After onboarding is completed once:
  - Do NOT show the guide again unless the user manually reopens it.

2. Usage Guide Page:
- Create a dedicated guide page (modal or full-page overlay).
- Purpose:
  - Explain how the diary system works.
  - Explain the relationship between yearly / monthly / weekly / daily plans.

3. Tooltip Help for Headings:
- For every major section heading (e.g. Yearly Plan, Monthly Plan, This Week, Daily Tasks):
  - Add a small “?” icon next to the heading.
- Interaction:
  - On mouse hover:
    - Show a tooltip explaining the purpose of this section.
  - Tooltip should:
    - Be non-intrusive
    - Auto-hide on mouse leave
- Tooltips must work throughout the app, not only in the guide page.

4. Guided Creation Flow:
- During first-time onboarding, guide the user step-by-step:

  Step 1:
  - Prompt the user to create:
    - Core Principles document
    - Yearly Plan
  - Provide a clear “Create Now” button.

  Step 2:
  - After Yearly Plan exists:
    - Prompt creation of Monthly Plan.

  Step 3:
  - After Monthly Plan exists:
    - Prompt creation of Weekly Plan.

  Step 4:
  - After Weekly Plan exists:
    - Prompt creation of Daily Plan.

- Users should not be forced, but clearly guided in this order.

5. Missing Embedded Content Handling:
- In daily / weekly / monthly pages:
  - If an embedded document does NOT exist:
    - Display placeholder text:
      “暂未创建对应的计划”
- Placeholder should:
  - Be visually distinct (muted or italic)
  - Be non-editable
  - Disappear automatically once the corresponding document is created.

6. Manual Access:
- Add a menu item or command palette option:
  - “Open Usage Guide”
- This allows users to re-open the guide at any time.

7. Persistence:
- Once onboarding is completed:
  - Store completion state locally.
- The guide should NOT appear again on normal app startup.
